# Coronavirus - (COVID-19) Full Stack Application
The idea behind this application is to displays the statistics of Coronavirus COVID-19 around the world and the data are being collected from [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) and it updates the cases constantly on this website around the world. 

## Technical Overview
This is a full-stack application which runs react.js in front-end and node.js in the back-end and it parses the data from [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) and stored in MongoDB database.

And it uses Mapbox to populate the coordinates on the map using GeoJSON format.
